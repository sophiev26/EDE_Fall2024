## OVERVIEW

This exercise accompanies the lessons in Environmental Data Analytics on generalized linear models. 

## Directions
1. Rename this file `<FirstLast>_A07_GLMs.Rmd` (replacing `<FirstLast>` with your first and last name).
2. Change "Student Name" on line 3 (above) with your name.
3. Work through the steps, **creating code and output** that fulfill each instruction.
4. Be sure to **answer the questions** in this assignment document.
5. When you have completed the assignment, **Knit** the text and code into a single PDF file.


## Set up your session 
1. Set up your session. Check your working directory. Load the tidyverse, agricolae and other needed packages. Import the *raw* NTL-LTER raw data file for chemistry/physics (`NTL-LTER_Lake_ChemistryPhysics_Raw.csv`). Set date columns to date objects.
```{r Setup 2}
#1
library(tidyverse)
library(agricolae)
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
library(lubridate)
library(corrplot)
library(here)
getwd()
here()


Lake_Chemistry <-read.csv(file=here
  ("Data/Raw/NTL-LTER_Lake_ChemistryPhysics_Raw.csv"),
  stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

Lake_Chemistry$sampledate<- as.Date(Lake_Chemistry$sampledate, 
                                    format = "%m/%d/%y")
```


2. Build a ggplot theme and set it as your default theme.

```{r setup3}
#2

my_theme <- theme(
plot.background = element_rect("#9CCAC6"), 
plot.title= element_text("#516ED2"),
theme(axis.text = element_text(color = "black"), 
        legend.position = "top"))

theme_set(my_theme)

```

## Simple regression
Our first research question is: Does mean lake temperature recorded during July change with depth across all lakes?

3. State the null and alternative hypotheses for this question:
> Answer:
H0: Mean Lake Temperature changes across depth in July 
Ha: Mean Lake Temperatre does not change across depth in July 

4.  Wrangle your NTL-LTER dataset with a pipe function so that the records meet the following criteria: 
 * Only dates in July. 
 * Only the columns: `lakename`, `year4`, `daynum`, `depth`, `temperature_C`
 * Only complete cases (i.e., remove NAs)

5. Visualize the relationship among the two continuous variables with a scatter plot of temperature by depth. Add a smoothed line showing the linear model, and limit temperature values from 0 to 35 °C. Make this plot look pretty and easy to read.


```{r scatterplot}
#4
lake_regression <-
Lake_Chemistry %>% 
  mutate(
    Month = month(sampledate)) %>% 
    filter(Month==07) %>% 
    select(lakename, year4, daynum, depth, temperature_C) %>% 
    na.omit()

#5
scatter_lake <- 
ggplot(lake_regression, aes(x=depth,
                  y=temperature_C))+
                  geom_point()+
                  geom_smooth(method="lm", col="blue")+
                  ylim(0,35)+
                  xlab("Depth")+
                  ylab("Temperature C")+
                  ggtitle("Temperature by Depth")
                  
print(scatter_lake)

```


6. Interpret the figure. What does it suggest with regards to the response of temperature to depth? Do the distribution of points suggest anything about the linearity of this trend?

> Answer: The deeper it is the colder it is. As the depth increases the temperature decreases, and we can see from the regression line that this is a linear model. These two values seem to be inversely related according to this figure. 


7. Perform a linear regression to test the relationship and display the results.

```{r linear.regression}
#7
lake_linear_regression <- lm(
  data = lake_regression,
  temperature_C ~ depth)
summary(lake_linear_regression)

cor.test(lake_regression$temperature_C, lake_regression$depth)

```


8. Interpret your model results in words. Include how much of the variability in temperature is explained by changes in depth, the degrees of freedom on which this finding is based, and the statistical significance of the result. Also mention how much temperature is predicted to change for every 1m change in depth. 

> Answer: To begin with, the p variable is smaller than 0.5 which makes it very statistically signficant. R squared is 0.7387 meaning that 73.87% of the variability in temperature can be explained by a change in depth. Furthermore, the standard deviation is -1.946 which notes that for every 1 meters increase in depth the temperature will change by 1.946ºC. As far as degrees of freedom, there are 9726 degrees of freedom for these results.

## Multiple regression
Let's tackle a similar question from a different approach. Here, we want to explore what might the best set of predictors for lake temperature in July across the monitoring period at the North Temperate Lakes LTER. 


9. Run an AIC to determine what set of explanatory variables (year4, daynum, depth) is best suited to predict temperature.

10. Run a multiple regression on the recommended set of variables. 

```{r temperature.model}
#9
LTPAIC <- lm(data = lake_regression , temperature_C ~ depth + daynum + year4)
step(LTPAIC)

#Choose a model by AIC in a Stepwise Algorithm

#10

Temp_model <- lm(data = lake_regression , temperature_C ~ depth + daynum +
year4)
summary(Temp_model)


```

11. What is the final set of explanatory variables that the AIC method suggests we use to predict temperature in our multiple regression? How much of the observed variance does this model explain? Is this an improvement over the model using only depth as the explanatory variable?

> Answer: The AIC did not get rid of any variables (temperature, depth, daynum, and year) becasue they were all statistically significant. The AIC is 26065.53 and all variables are bigger than this value. meaning the initial model is the best fit. This variable shows the coefficients including standard deviation error and p-value as well as the degrees of freedom and r squared. R squared explains the variability which mean 74.1% of this variance can be explained by this model. This model is an improvement because it uses more variables and extract unhelpful or muddled values that are not statistically significant enough to include. This leads to a more accurate result. However, the improvement is slight, only 0.24% improvement.

## Analysis of Variance

12. Now we want to see whether the different lakes have, on average, different temperatures in the month of July. Run an ANOVA test to complete this analysis. (No need to test assumptions of normality or similar variances.) Create two sets of models: one expressed as an ANOVA models and another expressed as a linear model (as done in our lessons).

```{r anova.model}
#12
lake.regression.anova <- aov(data = lake_regression, temperature_C ~ lakename)
summary(lake.regression.anova)

lake.regression.anova2 <- lm(data = lake_regression, temperature_C ~ lakename)
summary(lake.regression.anova2)

```

13. Is there a significant difference in mean temperature among the lakes? Report your findings. 

> Answer: Yes there is a signficant difference in mean temperatures among lakes as can be seen by the small P value (2.2e-16). 

14. Create a graph that depicts temperature by depth, with a separate color for each lake. Add a geom_smooth (method = "lm", se = FALSE) for each lake. Make your points 50 % transparent. Adjust your y axis limits to go from 0 to 35 degrees. Clean up your graph to make it pretty. 

```{r scatterplot.2}
#14.
scatter_lake_color <- 
ggplot(lake_regression, aes(x=depth,
                  y=temperature_C, color=lakename))+
                  geom_point(alpha=0.5)+
                  geom_smooth(method="lm", col="blue", se=FALSE)+
                  ylim(0,35)+
                  xlab("Depth")+
                  ylab("Temperature C")+
                  ggtitle("Temperature by Depth According to Lake")
                  
print(scatter_lake_color)
```

15. Use the Tukey's HSD test to determine which lakes have different means.

```{r tukey.test}
#15
TukeyHSD(lake.regression.anova)

# Extract groupings for pairwise relationships, groups = true are grouping 
#ones w same mean 
TukeyLake.Totals.groups <- HSD.test(lake.regression.anova, "lakename", 
group = TRUE)
TukeyLake.Totals.groups

```

16.From the findings above, which lakes have the same mean temperature, statistically speaking, as Peter Lake? Does any lake have a mean temperature that is statistically distinct from all the other lakes?

>Answer: Paul lake has the other mean temperature closest to Peter Lake. Ward Lake is also found in this grouping, although less similar than Peter and Paul. There are no statistically distinct groupings since every lake can be found in a grouping with another one. 

 
17. If we were just looking at Peter Lake and Paul Lake. What's another test we might explore to see whether they have distinct mean temperatures? 
 
>Answer: We could use a two-sample t-test which is used to test the hypothesis that the mwan of two samples is equivalent, or in this case, if Peter and Paul lakes are equivalent.


18. Wrangle the July data to include only records for Crampton Lake and Ward Lake. Run the two-sample T-test on these data to determine whether their July temperature are same or different. What does the test say? Are the mean temperatures for the lakes equal? Does that match you answer for part 16?

```{r t.test}
Wrangled_CramptonWard <-
lake_regression %>% 
    filter(lakename== "Crampton Lake" | lakename== "Ward Lake")
  
Wrangled_CramptonWard_Pivot <- pivot_wider(
Wrangled_CramptonWard, 
    names_from = lakename, values_from = temperature_C)

#Format as a t-test
cramptonward.twosample <- t.test(Wrangled_CramptonWard$temperature_C ~ Wrangled_CramptonWard$lakename)
cramptonward.twosample


```

>Answer: They are not equal (Crampton Lake = 15.35, Ward Lake = 14.46) which is also recognized in #16 as in the same mean group (group b, while also being in two other groups) but not equivalent
